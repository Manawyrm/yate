<markup><big><b>Events Log</b></big>

This window keeps record of status messages
displayed by Yate. You can use it to have a
second look at the messages that show up for a
too short time.

Text can be copied from here and pasted in an
editor or e-mail client for debugging purposes.

Please note that the event window text will not
persist if you stop the Yate client. You have
to copy any data before closing the program.
